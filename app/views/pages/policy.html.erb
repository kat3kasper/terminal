      <br>
      <p>Find My Flock (FMF) will be what is known as the controller of the personal data you provide to us.
      FMF is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This notice sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide us, will be processed by us.</p>
      <h5>Who we are and what we do</h5>
      <p>We are a recruitment agency and we collect personal data from the following types of people to allow us to undertake our business:
        <li>Prospective and placed candidates for permanent and contract roles</li>
        <li>Prospective and live client contacts</li>
        <li>Supplier contacts to support our services</li>
        <li>Employees, consultants, temporary workers</li></p>
        <h5>Types of Data We Collect</h5>
        <p>In order to provide the best possible employment opportunities that are tailored to our candidates, we need to process certain information. We only ask for details that will genuinely help us to help candidates find a new role, such as name, contact details, resume and immigration status (and other relevant information you may choose to share).
          <p>Where appropriate, and in accordance with local laws and requirements, we may also collect information related to diversity, security clearance status or details of any criminal convictions.</p>
          <p>If you are a FMF client, we need to collect and use information about you, or individuals at your organization, in the course of providing you with our recruitment services. This can include finding candidates to fill your roles, providing you with Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) services or notifying you of content published by FMF which may be relevant to you.</p>
          <p>FMF will also store information relating to previous dealings with us, including job applications, email and telephone communications, job interviews and placements.</p>
          <h5>Where we obtain your information</h5>
          <p>We may obtain candidate information from any number of locations:
            <li>When you register with our website or apply for jobs via our website</li>
            <li>When you correspond with us by phone, email or otherwise</li>
            <li>When you visit our website</li>
            <li>When you register your profile and it matches the skills a client company is looking for</li>
            <li>When you apply for one of our jobs</li>
            <li>When you are referred by a friend / colleague</li>
            <li>Your online profiles (GitHub, LinkedIn).</li></p>
            <p>When we obtain your information from external sources such as LinkedIn, corporate websites and job boards we will inform you, by sending you this privacy notice, within a maximum of 30 days of collecting the data of the fact we hold personal data about you, the source the personal data originates from, and for what purpose we intend to retain and process your personal data.
              There are two main ways in which we collect client data:
              <li>Directly from you</li>
              <li>From third parties such as candidates, online job boards, LinkedIn and networking.</li></p>
              <h5>Data Retention</h5>
              <p>We will delete candidate personal data from our systems if we have not had any meaningful contact with you for seven years (or for such longer period as we believe, in good faith, that the law or relevant regulators require us to preserve your data). After this period, it is likely your data will no longer be relevant for the purposes for which it was collected.</p>
              <p>We will consider there to be meaningful contact with you if you submit your updated resume onto our website, update your profile informations or apply for jobs in our database. We will also consider it meaningful contact if you communicate with us about potential roles, either by verbal or written communication or engage with any of our marketing communications.</p>
              <p>Under new data protection regulations (GDPR), we are required to keep the data we hold accurate and, where necessary, up to date. As such, we will make an effort to regularly communicate with you to ensure your data is up to date and accurate.</p>
              <p>Whilst we will endeavor to permanently erase your personal data once it reaches the end of its retention period or where we receive a valid request from you to do so, some of your data may still exist within an archive system. While certain details may still exist on an archive system, this cannot be readily accessed by any of our operational systems, processes or staff.</p>
              <h5>Legal Basis for Processing</h5>
              <p>Our legal basis for the processing of personal data is our legitimate business interests, described in more detail below, although we will also rely on contract, legal obligation and consent for specific uses of data.</p>
              <p>We will rely on contract if we are negotiating or have entered into a placement agreement with you or your organization or any other contract to provide services to you or receive services from you or your organization.</p>
              <p>We will rely on legal obligation if we are legally required to hold information on to you to fulfil our legal obligations.</p>
              <p>We will, in some circumstances, rely on consent for particular uses of your data and you will be asked for your express consent, if legally required. Examples of when consent may be the lawful basis for processing include permission to introduce you to a client (if you are a candidate).</p>
              <h5>Legitimate Interests</h5>
              <p>Here at FMF, we take your privacy seriously and will only use your personal information to administer your account and to provide you with our recruitment services.</p>
              <p>We think it's reasonable to expect that, if you are looking for employment or have posted your professional CV information on a job board or professional networking site, you are happy for us to collect and otherwise use your personal data to provide our recruitment services to you, share that information with prospective employers (with your consent) and assess your skills against our live vacancies. During the job offer process, your potential employer may also want to confirm your references, qualifications and criminal record, to the extent that this is appropriate and in accordance with the law. We need to do these things so that we can help you find the job you deserve.</p>
              <p>We want to provide you with tailored job alerts to help you on your job hunt. We therefore think it's reasonable for us to process your data to make sure that we send you the most appropriate jobs.</p>
              <p>We may also need to use your data for our internal administrative activities, like payroll and invoicing where relevant.</p>
              <h5>Data Storage and Processing</h5>
              <p>  All of the personal data we hold about you will be processed by our staff in the United States. We take all reasonable steps to ensure that your personal data is processed securely and prevent unauthorized access to, and misuse of your personal data.</p>
              <p>Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>
              <h5>Data Subject Access Requests</h5>
              <p>You may ask us to confirm what information we hold about you at any time, and request us to modify, update or delete such information. If you wish to access your data at any time, there will be no administration charge (unless the request is excessive) and the request should be fulfilled within 30 days. To make such a request, please email <a href="mailto:info@findmyflock.com">info@findmyflock.com</a>.</p>
              <h5>Changes to our privacy notice</h5>
              <p>Any changes we make to our privacy notice in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by email. Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our privacy notice.</p>
              <h5>Contact</h5>
              <p>Questions, comments or requests regarding this privacy notice are welcomed and should be addressed to <a href="mailto:info@findmyflock.com">info@findmyflock.com</a>.
