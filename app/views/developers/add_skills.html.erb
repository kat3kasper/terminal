            Hi! You’re a human and we rather like you, so we want to see you shine. Here are some tips to help you out.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li> Be honest about your skills. Your first impression is better when you are truthful.</li>
            <li> While we're at it, tell the truth about your visa status- it’s illegal (and punishable by law) if you don’t.</li>
            <li> Companies like to feel special too! Personalize your letters to each company instead of sending the same one every time.</li>
            <li> Not all jobs will fit you, and that’s okay. Apply to only the jobs that fit- ideally no more than 3 per day.</li>
          </ul>
