        Thank you for being a client of Find My Flock. We appreciate your investment in a diverse and inclusive mindset and process for candidates.

        <a href="https://turing.io" target="_blank">Turing School School of Software & Design</a> acquired Find My Flock in January 2019. Turing School is a Denver based, nonprofit, immersive seven month program for front-end and back-end engineering, with students graduating every six weeks. On average, our students are between 25 and 35 years old and leave our program with technical skills, as well as professional and life experience to bring into their careers as software developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this job board served a great and needed purpose, due to a strategy change we are closing services for Find My Flock. Although the website will be closed, Turing School would love to help you with your hiring needs for junior/mid/senior level developers. Our goal is to ensure our graduating students and alumni (who have several years of experience) can find great jobs with great companies!  
      </p>
      <p>
